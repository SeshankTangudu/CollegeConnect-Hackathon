## Overview

CollegeConnect is a role-based college event management prototype developed during my 1st year B.Tech hackathon.

The goal of the project was to design a centralized platform that simplifies event creation, team formation, venue booking, and event browsing for students and administrators.

This version represents the initial frontend prototype built during the hackathon.
